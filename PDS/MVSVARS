The only symbols available to JCL are the System Symbols
(IEASYMxx) and unless it is an STC, the list is very limited for
true batch.  PROC symbolics do not seem to apply here.  However,
you could do this little trick to seed your environment variables
with the symbol names and values.

MVSVARS.REX

/* rexx */
arg  var
say  mvsvar(var)

VARS.SH

#!/bin/sh
SYSNAME='mvsvars.rex SYSNAME'
export  SYSNAME
SYSCLONE='mvsvars.rex SYSCLONE'
export  SYSCLONE
SYSPLEX='mvsvars.rex SYSPLEX'
export  SYSPLEX

By "dotting in" the VARS.SH script in your .profile or wherever
necessary, you can seed these values in your environment.
