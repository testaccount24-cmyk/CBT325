Notes about the PRINTOFF TSO command   (for z/OS)
----- ----- --- -------- --- -------

The PRINTOFF TSO command, which prints a dataset to SYSOUT, has been
a favorite of programmers for years.  PRINTOFF was originally an IBM
"unsupported" program distributed with the IPO and CBIPO distribution
for new MVS systems.  Officially, it has now been replaced by IBM's
PRINTDS TSO command, which has slightly different syntax:

PRINTOFF  'dataset.name'

PRINTDS   DSN('dataset.name')

HELP for this version of PRINTOFF is included in the source code,
and is skipped over during assembly, via conditional assembly
instructions.  So you should copy the HELP stuff to your SYSHELP
library from within the source code.

This version of PRINTOFF, which was last (significantly) modified by
Sam Lepore of Wells Fargo Bank in 1986, produces the date and time in
its report and has similar bells and whistles to IBM's current PRINTDS
program, which of course, came out later.

I ran PRINTOFF recently.  The date came out as 1913.  (This is bad.)

Therefore..........

The PRINTOFF program was fixed in two ways.  (Second one is better.)

   Member PRINTOFF represents the second fix. (Use this one.)
   Member PRINTOFX represents the first fix.

   1.  I fixed it first.  See all the notes below.  The time stamp
       was dependent on two IBM modules, IKJEFLPA and IKJEFLPB.
       These have since been updated by IBM and are (to my
       knowledge) incompatible with PRINTOFF as it existed in 1986
       or so.  Therefore, I did two things.  First, if you have an
       existing load module, you can zap the first byte of module
       IKJEFLPB from X'19' and change it to X'20'.  See member
       PROF$ZAP which does this.  To fix the source code so you
       can reassemble it, I disassembled the two modules (old
       versions) and included them in the source code here, after
       (of course) changing the aforesaid X'19' to X'20'.

   2.  Bill Godfrey's old routine called JULSUB supplies the same
       date information that the IBM modules IKJEFLPA and IKJEFLPB
       supply.  The JULSUB routine is public-domain.  Therefore,
       the second fix was to substitute a call to JULSUB for the
       call to IKJEFLPA.  This is the preferred fix, and the source
       member PRINTOFF reflects this fix.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

All the following notes apply to the first fix, above.

Upon some investigation, I found how and where the date is created.
It is created by IBM module IKJEFLPA, which calls IBM module IKJEFLPB,
whose first byte has a hard-coded X'19' that has to be zapped to a
hard-coded X'20'.  Now that I found the problem, I got a second
problem.  The new version of IKJEFLPA (and IKJEFLPB) which IBM NOW
distributes, is not compatible with this program's CALL.  So the
PRINTOFF module, as (formerly) presented here, is not reassemblable on
current systems, with their new IKJEFLPA and IKJEFLPB.

Therefore I disassembled the old versions of IKJEFLPA and IKJEFLPB
which ARE compatible with PRINTOFF, included the zap for the 20xx
dates, and presented the entire package as one pds member to submit
for assembly and linkedit.  That is the PRINTOFX member that you see
here.  Just make the changes for your own installation, and assemble.
The HELP member is also part of this member, and is skipped over, in
the assembly, using conditional assembly instructions.  So you can
just copy the HELP part to your own SYSHELP library as member
PRINTOFF with all its aliases, and then you're set.
